<blockquote data-ipsquote="""" class=""ipsQuote"" data-ipsquote-username=""Frost Hammer"" data-cite=""Frost Hammer"" data-ipsquote-contentapp=""core"" data-ipsquote-contenttype=""reports"" data-ipsquote-contentid=""1""><div>Before I start, I'd like to clarify that I am not a communist, socialist, anarchist, or a liberal.  I'm just too left-wing to be considered a conservative.  I believe that the government should serve only to protect its citizens from harm, theft, and foreign military threats.  A government that tries to legislate in ""the National interest"" or ""The common good"" is obtrusive, and virtually always ends up creating more problems in the process.  So now that I've established that, I'd like to point out the biggest flaws in fascist ideology, and for that matter communist and socialist ideology as well.<p>While you might think that you're totally different from communists, you share the same social interference and ""we're gonna do what's best for you"" policies, which are the biggest problem with authoritarian governments whether you're a Baptist fundamentalist Neo-Nazi or an atheist, homosexual Marxist.</p>
<ul><li>I'm sure most of you expect that, if you get your way and a fascist state is established, you expect yourself to be part of the government, or at least you expect the government to fit your ideology.  That alone sets you off to a bad start.<br /></li>
<li>Government doesn't shape society, society shapes government.  No matter how strong a government is, it only has power because it operates within social guidelines and is thus tolerated by society.  Adolf Hitler's population would have lost faith in him rather quickly if he came out in, say, 1943, and said that he converted to Judaism, married a black woman, and became a pacifist.  The American government would quickly lose support if they started killing minorities and invading other countries unprovoked.  Hell, even the North Korean regime would be powerless if not for their isolationism, propaganda system, and ""education"" system.  The North Korean government has their society's support because they've managed to convince their society that every other country sucks, which was a long and complicated process.  If North Korean citizens knew what life was like in other countries, the government would quickly lose favor.<br />Just look at men compared to women, for example.  There is an extremely disproportionate amount of men compared to women in auto body, construction, electronics, engineering, the military, plumbing, etc.  Yet the government would face harsh and justified public outrage if they decided to ban women from working in these fields, because people's minds aren't any more affected by legislation than by anything else.  What could the government do if most people in the US started nonchalantly smoking marijuana in public?  Arrest everybody?  Tell them to stop?<br />Before you dismiss protestors and people who would oppose a fascist government's legislation as ""low-lifes"" and ""scum,"" I'd like to remind you that you envision yourselves agreeing with the fascist government, and many of you probably envision yourself being a part of it.  Now envision yourself being the sailor put out of a job because of isolationist trade regulations.  Imagine yourself being the writer told by the state that you're not allowed to write your own opinions any more, but you must write for the state.  And since fascist governments exercise authority in the name of ""The National Interest"" at whim, anyone at any time could be affected by some fascist governments.<br /></li>
<li>You're right about one thing.  Fascism would work out well if everybody cooperated with the government.  But the problem is, people don't cooperate with the government.  And it's not because they're ""low-lives"" or criminals who could simply be arrested.  It's because people don't naturally like being told what to do.  As phrased by Friedrich Hayek, ""The more the state ""plans,"" the more difficult planning becomes for the individual.""  And telling people that doing any of their own planning is unpatriotic and, God forbid, insubordinate doesn't help.<br /></li>
<li>The general notion that submission to the state is morally correct is pretty weak, to say the least.  In fact, it would be comical to think that the very premise of fascist ideology is based on nothing more than what you think is ""moral"" if it weren't so potentially harmful.  And what's even more ridiculous is that you think it's ""moral"" to submit to the government because you yourself support the government.  The hypocrisy is too much for me to handle.  If we are living under a communist government, there's nothing wrong with rebelling against the government, but if it's a fascist government that fits your ideology, then you are expected to support it.  Do I even need to explain why this is ridiculous?<br /></li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>And before you say that Fascist leaders in the past led their countries to ""greatness,"" I don't give a shit.  Greatness, which means power and glory, doesn't last.  The Greek Empire was powerful.  The Persian Empire was powerful.  Adolf Hitler's Empire was powerful.  Fascist Italy was powerful.  Not anymore.</p>
<p>Governments might have power to change the present, but no government has ever had an impact on society as much as they themselves were molded by society.  Governments don't create the future, they only establish ""glory"" and power in the present with war, propaganda, and relentless display of power.  The only ""greatness"" any government has produced was death, fear, and deceit.  For every ""great"" empire, there are thousands of people dead and enslaved, either by force or deceit.  The only way a country can leave an impact on the future is by allowing their society to create the future, and giving it room to run its natural course.</p>

<p>You are correct in this that we would try to form a uniform culture that the turanic nation can adhere to, including a language. It is under debate that Hungary will ever constitute a full political member of this union, perhaps a key ally above everyone else, since we lack connection by land or sea, however, the reason why we claim to be Turanists is because we're uniting people of a common blood, under a single banner.

<p style=""text-align:center;""><span style=""font-family:'courier new', courier, monospace;""><span style=""font-size:18px;""><span style=""color:#ff8c00;""><strong>Iron March Mission Statement</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;"">Iron March is a global online fascist community that seeks to become the <strong>Forge of the 21st Century Fascist</strong> by establishing an online <strong>Fascist Space</strong> so as to foster and develop internet resources dedicated to the study, understanding and practice of the <em>Fascist Worldview</em> and <em>Lifestyle</em>; and a global <strong>Fascist Fraternity</strong> in the world for the purpose of creating a non-movement/party form of association between fascists that can in turn lead to the strengthening of existing or formation of new</span><span style=""font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;""> movements that engage in our common struggle worldwide. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;"">Iron March itself is not a movement and never intends to become one, rather it is the platform for the creation of the global Fascist Fraternity and the central communications hub for its members online as well as the HQ for the online Fascist Space and the primary source for studying our worldview, thus acting as the <strong>Fascist Alma Mater</strong>.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;"">Furthermore, a distinction must be made that <strong>Iron March</strong> and <strong>Iron March <em>forum</em></strong><em> </em>(i.e.<em> IRONMARCH.ORG</em>) are not synonymous as the intent and ambitions outlined in this Mission Statement clearly show that Iron March has outgrown itself as just an internet forum, now encompassing an array of both online and real world activities and goals, making Iron March a living community while the Iron March forum acts as its online HQ. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size:12px;"">To further explain our intentions each key term mentioned above is explained below:</span></p>
<ul><li>
<span style=""font-size:12px;""><strong>Forge<em>(-ing)</em> of the 21st Century Fascist</strong> - the most broad and succinct way of describing our Mission Statement that covers both our online and real world activities, implying that we seeks to create not just mere political and career/hobbyist fascists but rather people who share an inherently different perception of the world and thus live and breathe Fascism 24/7, making it not just a mere ideology but a Worldview and Way of Life or Lifestyle, that in the Modern World would appear as a form of counter-culture.</span><p> </p>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-size:12px;font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;""><strong>Fascist Alma Mater</strong> - the role that the Iron March forum plays in educating people towards a more comprehensive understanding of the Fascist Struggle and Worldview, and a common way of referring to any Iron March projects dedicated to further research and education in those fields (<em>ex. Fascist Archive, Antimony Group</em>).</span><p> </p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Fascist Space</strong><span style=""font-size:12px;""> - common way of referring to all online Iron March projects and online projects/activities created by members of the IM community that in any way further our goals, including educational, creative, demonstrative outlets of the Fascist Lifestyle (<em>ex. NOOSE</em>).</span><p> </p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Fascist Fraternity</strong><span style=""font-size:12px;""> - Iron March community manifested in the real world as a means of fascist association that exists outside belonging to any particular movement or party, encouraging fascists to spend time together outside of movement activities or to the contrary bring together fascists with no existing affiliations to share in common interests or form some organization of their own. It is important to note that in the event of a movement's formation Iron March has no direct control over it and can merely offer advice as a community, in the hopes of nurturing the growth of a successful and dedicated fascist organization.</span>
</li>
</ul><p><span style=""font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;"">Most of the planning behind the aforementioned goals and projects occurs on our online HQ - the Iron March forum. As such the Forum Charter in no small part defines the nature of our community and can be used not as only a guide for using the forum itself but also as a point of reference to the standards of our community at large.</span></p>

<p>The Adminship are the Iron March Forum Admins, tasked with maintaining the forum, disciplinary actions, enforcing the values of our worldview and the planning of all IM projects to further our common goals.</p>
<p>The official symbol of the Adminship and the Iron March forum is the <em>Machina Hierarchia</em> - <em>Hierarchy Machine</em> (cog and hands) - it symbolizes the organic unity that exists in a proper hierarchy, making it work as smoothly and efficiently as a machine; alternatively it symbolizes the fostering of an organic unity from what were initially mechanical means.</p>
<p><strong>II. <span style=""color:rgb(255,140,0);"">Black Corps</span></strong></p>
<p>The Black Corps are the Iron March Forum Moderators - the most trusted and true who embody both the values that are at the foundation of this community and of the values of our worldview. The Black Corps are tasked with maintaining order and cleanliness on the forum, as well as seeking out and purging unwanted elements as outlined in segment <strong>III </strong>of this charter (<strong>Community</strong>). </p>
<p style=""font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;""> </p>

<p><strong>III. <span style=""color:rgb(255,140,0);"">Community</span></strong></p>
<p>Iron March is not a movement, but we expect users to share our purpose – to take an active interest in using the forum, and when contributing to do so as fascists in ultimate pursuit of knowledge, ideas, contacts, etcetera. Those who are not constructive and threaten this are in the wrong place and unwelcome. We recognize there is a widespread character issue in movement politics, and we start here to address some of those problems here. The following rules are to be observed by all members and handled quickly and diplomatically where possible.</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>No ‘Sperging’. As in ‘Asperger’s syndrome’, an Autistic mental disorder characterized by extreme egocentricity and an inability to understand how to interact socially. This policy is to curtail and recognize the tendencies of users whose actions and motivations are outside our common goals, are deliberately of no benefit to anyone, and only serve to cause trouble. Regardless of whether it is motivated by narcissism, social alienation, cowardice, or stupidity we must control it, and it is the user’s responsibility to observe these following principles which will serve as a guide to ensure there will be no problems for you while you are here.</p>
<p><strong>1.1 - </strong>Role-playing. The tendency to portray personal views in the third person with no clear relation to the real world constitutes a form of role-playing. Another form of role-playing is found in arrogance; insisting on special treatment or to be regarded as a separate tier, in contradiction to the fact it is usually marked by an absence of; personal effort, courage, commitment, consistency, positions that will attract negative response, interest in people, etc - by coincidence. If you are a fake you will be recognized and publicly called out.</p>
<p><strong>1.2 - </strong>Fashion Fascism. Fascism isn't a fetish – if you regularly treat it as such your motivations will be questioned as ulterior. If you reflect your political ‘identity’ in things like science fiction or anything else found in Television, Video games, hobbies, sub-cultures etc, it tells us that you are unable to distinguish between the two.</p>
<p><strong>1.3 - </strong>Shitposting. Making shit posts; this happens when a post is devoid of content or context, eg randomly responding with a reaction image. If you have nothing else to contribute you have no right to be engaging in this.</p>
<p><strong>1.4 - </strong>Constructive debate. The goal of debate is the pursuit of truth therefore you should take care about what you are saying and care about opposing arguments and should assume it is the same for your opponent – so where relevant you should be capable of providing sources to back up an opinion - this is an argument. Ignoring responses while continuing to argue shows you have no investment in the discussion and also, that you have nothing to offer or contribute.</p>
<p><strong>1.5 - </strong>Conduct. It is your responsibility to judge group relations and know what not to post and where things should be posted. When you can participate in a forum drama, promote yourself, become insolent towards members, etc, is something only you can judge.</p>
<p><strong>If these are not monitored by the user and kept in check it may result in messages of warning from moderators.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> This is not <em>Stormfront</em>. Our community is based on discussion and debate constructive towards fascist goals<em>, it is not a hangout for White Nationalists and their unique subculture. Stormfront </em>and <em>VNN </em>forums already provide this in terms of its endless topics on conspiracy theories, chimpouts, Zionism, etcetera. Exclusively posting remarks and threads of that nature without proper context is a form of spamming<em>.</em></p>
<p style=""font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;""> </p>
<p style=""font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;"">Likewise, we are not a <em>New Right</em> intellectual circle jerk and we do not tolerate aimless, abstract philosophizing and the typical self-important snobbish behavior that comes with it. Furthermore we recognize displays of such behavior to be a form of violation of points outlined in segment <strong>III </strong>of this charter (<strong>Community</strong>).</p>
<p style=""font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;""> </p>
<p style=""font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;""><strong>3.</strong> Tolerance. We accept people with strong viewpoints even if ultimately we seek everyone to join us in our comprehension of the world, whilst also understanding that this can be accomplished only so far via our internet forum platform. Those who take themselves too seriously yet refuse to debate become paranoid, patronizing, passive aggressive and can become the source of drama. Users of non straight-white-male-fascist backgrounds also need to be conscious of their differences and check their privilege at the door. If you have allowed yourself to become aggravated through your own fault we will not side with you and you may be held responsible.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Sophian Language. You are expected to use this website with intelligence, knowing not what to write and to read between the lines. Nobody is likely to monitor the website or trawl through your messages, but by posting here you need to personally be prepared it might be read in a court, quoted on in a newspaper, or read to your weeping mother – and hold yourself to account. Don't ask us to delete all your posts because you have ""changed your mind."", or even attempt to alter them yourself. Remember you public posts are cached by search engines or may be recorded by others.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Untermenschen. Just being you can result in an immediate ban, and we will take immediate and permanent action if it is ever found out the following applies to you.</p>
<p><strong>5.1</strong> - We do not allow or entertain the mentally ill to the extent they cannot understand fascism, (for instance those who do genuinely suffer from Autism) and it is our responsibility to direct them away from this place because they should not be here.</p>
<p><strong>5.2</strong> - Expression of interest in Paedophilia (Including any similar inclinations towards the under-aged) will result immediate ban, and even the slightest hint will be treated seriously.</p>
<p><strong>5.3</strong> - Simply put, we reserve the right to ban you if you are any kind of faggot. If you feel the need to tell the world then you will bring the consequences on yourself just as hard. Belonging to the furry fandom is prohibited, partly because it also involves a breach of 1.1 and 1.2, but mostly because it is utterly degenerative (it deserves note here because it will apply even if explicitly sexual grounds cannot be ascertained).</p>
<p>Failure to comply may result in <em>internment</em>, when a member's activity on the forum is restricted to the Showers. These members will be marked as <strong>Prisoners </strong>and they will inevitably be <strong>Gassed</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>IV. <span style=""color:rgb(255,140,0);"">Forum Activities</span></strong></p>
<p>Iron March Forum provides it's users with a number of activities that help us develop as a forum, an information center and a community for fellow fascists as well as establish new projects outside the Forum both online and in real life. Any user can officially sign up for any such activity and become an active contributor. Simply follow the rules of each such activity and you will find yourself occupied with interesting projects that will help you develop your skills or further your knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>V. <span style=""color:rgb(255,140,0);"">Discipline</span></strong></p>
<p>We expect every user to follow the rules set forth by the Adminship.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Our community is interested in active members, not lurker and defunct profiles. All accounts that have <em>zero</em> posts for a week after registry on the forum will be deleted. Once a year (sometime in January) the forum undergoes cleaning of defunct profiles, meaning that any years old profiles with less than 10 posts are permanently deleted. The more the forum membership grows with active users the higher the number of posts required to prevent deletion will become. </p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Before creating a new topic make sure that a similar one doesn't already exist and be sure to post topics in the appropriate sections of the Iron March forum. Use the search bar in the top right corner if  you are not sure where to look.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Do not derail topics, do not flame, do not spam (outside <a href=""<___base_url___>/index.php?/forum/78-cancer/"" title="""" rel="""">Cancer</a> and the <a href=""<___base_url___>/index.php?/forum/13-wastelands/"" title="""" rel="""">Wastelands</a>).</p>
<p><em>*It is the user’s responsibility not to be trolled.</em></p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Follow the respective rules of all forum activities and projects as they are explained in the sections dedicated to those activities.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Moderators and Admins may dispense punishment at their discretion and can give formal warnings to users who behave in an unacceptable manner (unnecessary aggression, blatant and systematic disregard of the forum rules and etc) with 3 and more warnings being grounds for temporary suspension or immediate gassing, or in some cases said penalties can happen with no warning at all. </p>

<p> </p>sup bitch, back from the dead m8; it's ur favorite faggot.<p>You know I got to say, for someone who calls people out for being cowards; I find it very ironic that you hide my visibility of forums on that account I made just to send that complaint. Not only that, but you disable my ability to reply back to you on that account. </p>
<p>You seem scared. What are you hiding from?</p>
<p>I take it you're some 30-40 year old autistic neck beard, working some shitty part time job, and on your off-time; you run a website where you make fun of kids barely 1 year out of highschool. Very admirable I must say. You must be proud, gettin' all dat pussy. What's your pick-up line? ""Hey so, I make fun of kids half my age on internet forums""</p>
<p>Anyways I should be thanking you really. I came here to get some stuff off your site, but ever since then- I've been getting tons of people coming from this website to my Youtube channel. Past couple of days, my adsense revenue has gone WAYYYY up. You've made me a good 100$ just by sharing my message on the forum.</p>
<p>I also find that humorous. You post my message and your response as if you're saying: ""HEY GUYS. ARN'T I SO COOL? I JUST MADE FUN OF THIS KID HALF MY AGE ON THE INTERNET"" That seriously has to be the most autistic-ass thing I've heard in my fucking life; and that's coming from a guy who made a damn relationship animation. I have to hand it to you though, you've truly outdone me.</p>
<p>You know what my biggest mistake was? Taking that video down. In under a week, it got 30,000 views and made me a good 500$. I really do regret it; but hey- with my name and those pictures becoming more relevant and active as of late... I might make a few more hundred just off of people finding about me here and being redirected to my channel. Here I was concerned about it, but you've provided something very opportune to me here!</p>
<p>Keep talking about me on your site m8! Loving the attention!</p>
<p>Also feel free to spam me; I know your autistic mind can't help it. I won't be visiting this pathetic site or the fake email linked with this account anytime soon. So really, go nuts! <img src=""<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png"" alt="";)"" srcset=""<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x"" width=""20"" height=""20"" /></p>
<p>P.S. While you're at it, make sure to continue making references to a video that has been off the internet for over a year now. Seems like you're too much of a bitch to think of anything else.</p>

<p>It's the same all over the west, your situation and worries are hardly unique.

Child-rearing is not that hard, if you both have strong beliefs and can make it clear what's going on in this world to your children, and keep them away from the most degenerate sources of filth (urban areas, social media, public education etc), they'll turn out fine.</p>

<p><strong>Organisation of Yugoslav Nationalists </strong>(ORYUNA) was formed on the 25th of January 1921. It was a political organisation in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia supported corporatism and Yugoslav integral nationalism. It was anti-communist, anti-liberal, anti-democratic, anti-Jewish. It was mostly active in Dalmatia and Slovenia where most of its members lived.  They attacked communists, Jews, Serbian nationalists and Croat nationalists so pretty much it was Yugoslavia or nothing for them. They were disbanded in 1929 when King Alexander I took power and started a dictatorship.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This text is from Wikipedia:</p>
<p>ORJUNA was founded in March 1921 in Split by the royal administrator of Croatia and funded by the provincial government to secure Yugoslavia from threats posed by communists, separatists, and other persons deemed threatening to the state.[6] The first president was Marko Nani and the first secretary Edo Bulat. The first actions organized by JNNO were demonstrations against communists because of the communist assassination of the Minister of Interior Milorad Drašković. JNNO organized demonstrations in Split, Zagreb and Osijek. In Zagreb, JNNO members even demolished offices of newspapers that blamed the government for assassination.</p>
<p>It was particularly influential in areas of Slovenia and Croatia that were of interest to Italian and Austrian irredentism as well as in areas where ethnic minorities where viewed to be powerful or separatist, such as Hungarians in Vojvodina. The membership of the movement was ethnically mixed of the various Yugoslav nationalities. However most of its members were Croats from Dalmatia. It ran its own newspapers, had an academic club, a labour organization, a high school students wing ""Young Yugoslavia"", and a paramilitary organization, the Action Section.</p>
<p>After 1922 people of all age groups started to join the organization, which changed its name in May 1922 to ORJUNA. ORJUNA's main political goal was maintaining a unitary Yugoslav state. Its members clashed with Austrian and Italian border patrols. ORJUNA never participated directly in elections but its supporters voted for Yugoslav oriented parties. In 1929, when the King proclaimed his personal dictatorship and disbanded the parliament, ORJUNA supported the King's action, but because the King outlawed all political parties and organizations ORJUNA ceased to exist.</p>
<p>By 1925, ORJUNA's Action Groups accounted for 10,000 people.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><hr /><p><strong>Yugoslav Action </strong>was a fascist organisation from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Not many things are known about this organisation as sources and books are scarce. I heard somewhere that their symbol was a swastika and that the wore blue armbands with a swastika on them. The whole organisation was integrated into ZBOR in 1935 when ZBOR was founded. Until the end of WWII and the dissolution of ZBOR in Yugoslavia members of the Yugoslav Action were known to be a hardline wing of ZBOR, a more ""extreme"" wing.</p>
<p>The organisation supported King Alexander's dictatorship and openly supported corporatism. Many people claimed the organisation to be fascist but YA members denied it.</p>

	Out of curiosity, why do you allow negros and other non-Europeans here? This is what it <em>will</em> get to (see: the post). Racial conflict even if just online. And I don't buy that its just heated banter. Fascism being universal isn't an excuse. Reality seeps in even to Internet forums.
</p>

<p>
	Before making my introduction I was considering (not really seriously but it left a bad taste in my mouth about this ""tolerance"") not even registering because I saw these people making introductions and posts here.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if there grows a community of, say, negroes on IM. Then one of them might get higher up in the ranks, maybe a moderator. Then he would inevitably start abusing his power at some point against other races.
</p>

<p>
	Have things always been like this on IM? I have only glimpsed at posts here when I lurked and didn't notice this before.
</p>

<p>
	This is what you might enable to form in the long run: a cesspool. I know I'm a new user but I will give criticism if I really believe its valid, and I believe it is now.
</p>

<p>
	I hope this site will continue to be as great as it is now and become even greater, so you will need to deal with this issue of race in the forums eventually I believe.
